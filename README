A PoC Python server process that lets a browser engage in a long poll
process. This makes it possible to remote control the browser  by sending
it Javascript commands.

Start browsercanvas.py then point a browser to 

    http://localhost:8000/testpage.html

then switch back to the window running the Python service and enter 
some javascript, for example:

    $('div1').innerHTML="<a href='http://www.google.com'>GOOGLE</a>"

Enjoy!
